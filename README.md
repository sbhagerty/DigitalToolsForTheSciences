# DigitalToolsForTheSciences

This is the repository for [Session Five of the Digital Pedagogy workshop](https://sites.google.com/brandeis.edu/digitalpedagogy/session-5) at Brandeis University. 

During the workshop we used Rstudio Cloud, with a preloaded dataset. That dataset is called DataSet.csv located in the [rawData](rawData) file, in that file you can also see the [DataCleaning.Rmd](rawData/DataCleaning.Rmd) to see all that we did to get the data we downloaded from the World Bank into the mostly ready to graph form.  

[DigitalToolsLesson.Rmd](DigitalToolsLesson.Rmd) is the Rmd file the workshop started with, where some of the code boxes are blank so you can practice writing the code.  We have a fully completed version also uploaded called [DigitalToolsLessonCompleted.Rmd](DigitalToolsLessonCompleted.Rmd). 

If you have any questions about this material let us know!
